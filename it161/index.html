    <h2 class="subheader">About Me</h2>
     
    <p>My interest in computer development sparked during my undergraduate studies in electrical engineering. The elegant logic and problem-solving skills I cultivated during that time naturally led me to explore coding. Eager to delve deeper into this realm, I decided to pursue a certificate in Software Development at Seattle Central College.
    </p>
        
    <p>Throughout the initial stages of my certificate program, I've been introduced to the fundamentals of programming, learning languages like Python and Java and to the web development basics. These early experiences have already opened my eyes to the endless possibilities that coding offers. I'm fascinated by the power to turn a simple line of code into a dynamic application or a beautifully crafted website.</p>

    <p>While I'm yet to accumulate a wealth of accomplishments in the field, I'm determined to make the most of my studies, building a strong portfolio of projects and continuously improving my skills. I aspire to work as a software developer in a dynamic and innovative company upon completing my certificate, where I can contribute to exciting projects and be part of shaping the digital world.</p>
      
    <p>My goal during this certificate program is to acquire a strong foundation in software development, focusing on and expanding my knowledge in artificial intelligence and machine learning while actively contributing to innovative projects that have a positive impact on society. I am excited to continue my journey in computer development, embracing the challenges and opportunities that the ever-evolving tech landscape offers.</p>
